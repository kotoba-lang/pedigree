(ns kotoba.pedigree
  "Material pedigree / certificate-of-conformance -- pure data
  contracts for cross-actor supply-chain linkage (ADR-2607999950).

  Every `cloud-itonami-isic-*` open business in this fleet is built on
  a strict 'pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network'
  discipline (see `kotoba.robotics`'s own docstring: 'policy, not
  control', the same boundary this library extends). Until this
  library existed, that discipline meant every vertical actor was a
  complete silo: an upstream actor's real, physics-simulation-derived
  quality telemetry (e.g. `cloud-itonami-isic-2410`'s steel-coupon
  tensile-test reading) had no way to reach a downstream actor's
  governor (e.g. `cloud-itonami-isic-2930`'s weld/fastener
  acceptance check) except as an invented number or an unverifiable
  self-report -- even though the two verticals are conceptually a
  supply chain.

  This library is the shared EDN interchange schema that closes that
  gap WITHOUT a live network call between actors: an upstream actor's
  `export` namespace packages a `pedigree` record from data it
  already has on file (never inventing a claim), and a downstream
  actor's `propose`/intake operation accepts that record as a plain
  data argument (a test/demo/orchestration script passes the EDN --
  never an HTTP fetch). The downstream governor then independently
  re-verifies the pedigree's own shape and claims before trusting it
  -- the SAME 'ground truth, not self-report' discipline every
  governor in this fleet already applies within a single actor, now
  extended ACROSS actors.

  Schema (a `pedigree` record):

    {:pedigree/id             \"PEDIGREE-heat-1\"   ; issuing lot/certificate id, string
     :pedigree/subject-lot-id \"heat-1\"            ; the specific lot/batch this pedigree is about
     :pedigree/issuing-actor  \"cloud-itonami-isic-2410\" ; business-id of the issuing actor
     :pedigree/claims         {:tensile-test-load-n 5000.0} ; verified, NUMERIC claims only -- never a self-reported string
     :pedigree/evidence-basis [\"steelworks.robotics/run-tensile-test ...\"] ; non-empty vector of source citations
     :pedigree/issued-at      \"2026-07-15\"}       ; ISO date string

  This library does not know what any particular claim key means
  (e.g. whether `:tensile-test-load-n` clears some acceptance floor)
  -- that acceptance-threshold judgment belongs entirely to the
  DOWNSTREAM actor's own governor (mirrors `kotoba.robotics`'s own
  `gate` not knowing whether any particular safety class is allowed;
  that judgment is the caller's `allowed-safety-classes` argument).
  This library only guarantees the record's SHAPE is honest: required
  fields present, claims numeric, evidence non-empty.

  No network, no I/O. Portable `.cljc` across JVM / ClojureScript /
  SCI / GraalVM, structurally modeled on `kotoba-lang/robotics`.")

(defn claim
  "Construct a pedigree record. `id` is the issuing lot/certificate id,
  `subject-lot-id` the upstream lot/batch the pedigree is about,
  `issuing-actor` the issuing business-id (e.g.
  \"cloud-itonami-isic-2410\"), `claims` a map of verified, numeric
  readings (never a self-reported string). `:evidence-basis` (a seq of
  source citations) and `:issued-at` (an ISO date string) are supplied
  by the caller -- this fn takes no wall-clock reading itself, keeping
  it pure/deterministic like every other constructor in this fleet.

  Returns nil (never a partially-built record) when `id`/
  `subject-lot-id`/`issuing-actor` are not non-empty strings or
  `claims` is not a map -- mirrors `kotoba.robotics/action`'s
  minimal-membership-check-then-build shape. This is a SHALLOW
  presence check only; use `valid?` for the full shape/type
  validation a downstream governor needs before trusting the record."

  "Full shape/type validation of a pedigree record -- what a downstream
  governor calls to independently verify an upstream actor's claim

  value just because it is non-nil; a hand-assembled or transmitted
  map must still pass this). True only when:

    - `:pedigree/id`/`:pedigree/subject-lot-id`/`:pedigree/issuing-
      actor` are all non-empty strings
    - `:pedigree/claims` is a non-empty map whose values are ALL
      numbers (never a self-reported string, keyword, or nil)
    - `:pedigree/evidence-basis` is a non-empty vector of strings
    - `:pedigree/issued-at` is a non-empty string

  Non-map input (or any other shape mismatch) is simply false, never
  an exception -- a downstream governor must be able to call this on
